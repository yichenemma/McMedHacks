# McMedHacks project by CaffineOverflow
## Project overview
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 continues to infect more than 500 000 people daily even after the widespread vaccination against it. The common method used to detect COVID-19is PCR tests, however some facilities might not have enough equipment and trained professionals for the amount of tests needed. Therefore our team proposes to detect Covid-19 through chest X-rays (CXR), which can minimize transportation of patients with portable radiography units which are easy to disinfect. Our project consisted of two parts. First, using a CNN, our project aims at determining if X-ray images represent healthy patients or Covid-19 patients and propose this innovative method of Covid-19 detection.(insert data) Second, we used Grad-CAM to determine which area of the CXR is essential for analyses. (insert data) By the end of this project, we were able to determine whether a patient has COVID-19 with an accuracy of (data), found the key area of analysis for the result which is (data), and have made a website for better user experience.
