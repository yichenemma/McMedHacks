## Project overview
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 , also known as COVID-19, continues to infect more than 500,000 people daily even after the widespread vaccination against it. The common method used to detect COVID-19 is PCR tests, however some facilities might not have enough equipment and trained professionals for the amount of tests needed. Therefore our team proposes to detect COVID-19 through chest X-rays (CXR), which can minimize transportation of patients with portable radiography units which are easy to disinfect. Our project consisted of two parts. <br>

Our project consisted of two parts. <br>
- First, using a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our project aims at determining if X-ray images represent healthy patients or COVID-19 patients and propose this innovative method of COVID-19 detection.
-  Second, we used Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to determine which area of the CXR is essential for analyses. <br>

By the end of this project, we were able to determine whether a patient has COVID-19 with an accuracy of (data), found the key area of analysis for the result which is (data), and have made a website for better user experience.
