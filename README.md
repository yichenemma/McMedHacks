# McMedHacks project by CaffineOverflow
## Project overview
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 continues to infect more than 500 000 people daily even after the widespread vaccination against it. The common method used to detect COVID-19is PCR tests, however some facilities might not have enough equipment and trained professionals for the amount of tests needed. Therefore our team proposes to detect Covid-19 through chest X-rays (CXR), which can minimize transportation of patients with portable radiography units which are easy to disinfect. <br>

Our project consisted of two parts. <br>
- First, using a CNN, our project aims at determining if X-ray images represent healthy patients or Covid-19 patients and propose this innovative method of Covid-19 detection.
- Second, we used Grad-CAM to determine which area of the CXR is essential for analyses. <br>

By the end of this project, we were able to determine whether a patient has COVID-19 with an accuracy of (data), found the key area of analysis for the result which is (data), and have made a website for better user experience.

## How to run the application?
To lunch the websit. Run the app.py through this command in the terminal. \
*_Note: The porgram might requires installation of some packages and libraries_*
> python app.py

The similar result should be produced as following

> Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/ \
> *Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)\
> *Environment: production\
> WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.\
> Use a production WSGI server instead.\
> *Debug mode: on
